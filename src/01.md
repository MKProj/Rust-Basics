# Getting Started

Rust is a systems programming language that combines the speeds of a low level programming 
language, as well as the memory safety with a high programming language. This makes Rust 
a very impressive language as these aspects are an either or, however Rust is able to 
reach this with it's ideals of Ownership, and the fact that it does not use a garbage collector.  

Rust was developed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, and it first publically appeared at July 7, 2010, since then it developed its own foundation funded by many corporations, and is called the Rust Foundation, 
. It has gained remarks of a language not only similar in syntax to C++, but could possibly start replacing it in a company's application for more safe and secure code. This has proved to 
be true for MKProjects as the first command line project was written in C++, but however the reliability 
of an infinite loop is anything but reliable, so looking into Rust has been a good decision as 
it now runs most of the projects, even this book is created using Rust!!!

## Install 
To install Rust, it is recommended to install via Rustup so visit [rustup.rs](http://rustup.rs)

## Rust Compiler

In the first few sections we will be utilizing the Rust Compiler, 
and it used as `rustc file.rs` which will create a binary that can 
be executed. In this book, it will reflect upon the linux terminal, 
however Unix Systems like MacOS will not differ, and Windows will
have `.exe` files instead of binary files. 

## Extra Resources
Keep in mind this is only an entry point into Rust and obviously doesn't cover everything that Rust offers, (and trust me there's a lot), so it is 
good to look into extra resources, and good for you that the Rust Foundation already has you covered. 

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
  - This is a good introduction to Rust and can cover more topics in better detail

- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
  - Learn Rust in a more interactive way with examples

- [Command Line Book](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html)
  - Create Command Line applications using Structopts 

- [WebAssembly Book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/)
  - Create Web applications with Rust and Webassembly

- [Embedded Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/embedded-book)
  - Created programs for embedded system with Rust

There is many more books provided by the Rust Foundations, so make sure
