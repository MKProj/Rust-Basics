# Control Flow


## If Statements
An `if` statement is a block of code that can be executed by a program if 
a condition results to `true`. For example let's ask the user for a number 
from 1 to 10, if it's less than 5, we will say `"Wow that's low huh!"`. 


```rust
use std::io::stdin; //To get standard input 

fn main(){
    let mut input = String::new();
    println!("Enter a number from 1 to 10!");
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap(); //Gets user input 

    //Now to convert the String to i32
    let i:i32 = input.trim().parse().expect("Expected an integer");

    if i < 5 {
        println!("Wow that's low huh!");
    }
}
```

> As you can see, we have the `if` keyword followed by the condition, such as `i < 5` 
> then the block of code executed is surrounded by `{ }`. 

## Else Clause 
This program isn't really that good, it only gives you something if you guess a number less than 5, but let's say I guess 8? I should still get something, and that's when the `else` clause comes in, unlike the `if` statement, it will execute a block of code 
only if it results to `false`. So let's fix our program so when I guess 5 or greater I am presented with `"Buddy you guessed too high!"`. 

```rust
use std::io::stdin; //To get standard input 

fn main(){
    let mut input = String::new();
    println!("Enter a number from 1 to 10!");
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap(); //Gets user input 

    //Now to convert the String to i32
    let i:i32 = input.trim().parse().expect("Expected an integer");

    if i < 5 {
        println!("Wow that's low huh!");
    } else {
        println!("Buddy you guessed too high!");
    }
}
```
> Notice how when you're using the `else` clause, you don't require a 
> condition, since it's like a default.

## Else if Statement
Now I got another problem with my program, I want something to happen when they guess 
5, so how do I do that, add another `if` statement? But that would look so disgusting, 
so instead why not add an `else if` statement? An `else if` statement is like a second order condition, if the first `if` statement results to false, then the `else if` statement is checked, and if it results to `true` then it's block of code is executed. 

```rust
use std::io::stdin; //To get standard input 

fn main(){
    let mut input = String::new();
    println!("Enter a number from 1 to 10!");
    stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap(); //Gets user input 

    //Now to convert the String to i32
    let i:i32 = input.trim().parse().expect("Expected an integer");

    if i < 5 {
        println!("Wow that's low huh!");
    } else if i == 5{
        println!("You guessed right!!!");
    } else {
        println!("Buddy you guessed too high!");
    }
}
```
