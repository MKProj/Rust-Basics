\chapter{Getting Started}

\par Rust is a systems programming language that combines the speeds of a low level programming 
language, as well as the memory safety with a high programming language. This makes Rust 
a very impressive language as these aspects are an either or, however Rust is able to 
reach this with it's ideals of Ownership, and the fact that it does not use a garbage collector.  

\par Rust was developed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, and it first publically appeared at July 7, 2010, since then it developed its own foundation funded by many corporations, and is called the Rust Foundation, 
.It has gained remarks of a language not only similar in syntax to C++, but could possibly start replacing it in a company's application for more safe and secure code. This has proved to 
be true for MKProjects as the first command line project was written in C++, but however the reliability 
of an infinite loop is anything but reliable, so looking into Rust has been a good decision as 
it now runs most of the projects, even this book is created using Rust!!!

\paragraph{Install} 
To install Rust, it is recommended to install via Rustup so visit [rustup.rs](http://rustup.rs)

\paragraph{Rust Compiler}

In the first few sections we will be utilizing the Rust Compiler, 
and it used as \verb!rustc file.rs! which will create a binary that can 
be executed. In this book, it will reflect upon the linux terminal, 
however Unix Systems like MacOS will not differ, and Windows will
have \verb!.exe! files instead of binary files. 

\paragraph{Extra Resources}
\par Keep in mind this is only an entry point into Rust and obviously doesn't cover everything that Rust offers, (and trust me there's a lot), so it is 
good to look into extra resources, and good for you that the Rust Foundation already has you covered.
